# Oriel Dashboard

Custom Lovelace strategy for Home Assistant — auto-generates the whole dashboard from area / device / entity metadata, then layers a setup wizard, per-user layouts, HACS plugin shims (Bubble Card, ApexCharts, decluttering-card, floorplan-card), a plugin extension API, and ten custom cards on top.

Built on the foundation [simon42-dashboard-strategy](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy) established (auto-generated room views, summary tiles, area grid) and extends it with power-user surface above. Not aimed at replacing the upstream — Simon42 remains the right pick for users who want a focused, opinionated auto-dashboard. Oriel is for those who want more handles to pull. Simon42 users can migrate over with a one-shot YAML edit; see MIGRATION.md.

## Architecture

**Language:** TypeScript (ES2020, strict mode)
**Build:** Webpack → code-split chunks (main + lit + core + views + editor on-demand)
**Distribution:** HACS-compatible (Custom Repository), deployed to `/config/www/community/oriel-dashboard/`

### Data Flow

1. **Entry Point** registers custom elements, calls `Registry.initialize(hass, config)` synchronously
2. **Registry** reads entity/device/area data from `hass` object (synchronous), builds pre-computed Maps/Sets
3. **Utils** collect persons, weather, favorites using pre-filtered Registry methods
4. **Section Builders** generate overview, areas, weather/energy sections
5. **View Builders** generate utility views (lights, covers, security, batteries, climate) + per-area room views
6. **Custom Cards** render reactive UI (real-time `hass` updates via `set hass()`)

### Registry — Core Design

The Registry is a **static singleton** (no instance, all static members). Initialized once, then provides O(1) lookups everywhere.

**Synchronous Init** (reads directly from hass object, no WebSocket needed):
```
Object.values(hass.entities)  → EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[]
Object.values(hass.devices)   → DeviceRegistryEntry[]
Object.values(hass.areas)     → AreaRegistryEntry[]
```
Called once in dashboard strategy `generate()` before views are returned. Idempotent — subsequent calls in view strategies are no-ops.

**Pre-Computed Maps:**

| Map | Key | Value | Filtered? |
|-----|-----|-------|-----------|
| `_entityById` | entity_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry | Raw |
| `_deviceById` | device_id | DeviceRegistryEntry | Raw |
| `_entitiesByDevice` | device_id | entity_id[] | Raw |
| `_entitiesByDomain` | domain | entity_id[] | Raw |
| `_entitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | Raw |
| `_visibleEntitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | **Pre-filtered** |
| `_visibleEntitiesByDomain` | domain | entity_id[] | **Pre-filtered** |
| `_configDiagEntitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | Config/diagnostic only |

Raw Maps stay available for the Editor (needs all entities for show/hide toggles).

**Pre-Filtering** (applied once during init via `_isEntityVisible()`):
- Not in `_excludeSet` (no "no_dboard" label)
- Not in `_hiddenFromConfig` (not in `areas_options.*.groups_options.*.hidden`)
- Not `hidden_by` (user or integration)
- Not `disabled_by` (user or integration)
- Not `entity_category` "config" or "diagnostic"

Downstream code uses pre-filtered methods directly — no redundant inline checks.

### Entity Filtering Pipeline

```
Entity → no_dboard label? → areas_options hidden? → Registry status (hidden_by, disabled_by)?
      → Category check (config/diagnostic excluded) → Platform filter → Dedup → Display
```

### HA Entity Registry vs. State-Attributes (CRITICAL)

Many entity properties exist ONLY in the Entity Registry, NOT in state attributes. Always use the registry as primary source:

| Property | Registry (`hass.entities[id]`) | State attributes |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| `hidden_by` | "user", "integration", null | NOT available |
| `disabled_by` | "user", "integration", null | NOT available |
| `entity_category` | "config", "diagnostic", null | Sometimes copied, often missing |
| `platform` | "mobile_app", "mqtt", etc. | NOT available |
| `device_id` | device UUID | NOT available |

**Rule:** Always read `hidden_by`, `disabled_by`, `entity_category`, and `platform` from the registry. Group cards (lights, covers) get entities pre-filtered from the registry array — they have these fields directly on the entity object. The summary card works with `hass.states` keys and must look up registry entries via `hass.entities?.[id]`.

### Config Hierarchy

- **Global toggles**: show_weather, show_energy, show_summary_views, show_room_views, group_by_floors, show_covers_summary, show_clock_card, show_light_summary, show_security_summary, show_battery_summary, show_climate_summary, show_search_card, show_locks_in_rooms, hide_mobile_app_batteries, group_lights_by_floors, use_default_area_sort, show_switches_on_areas, show_alerts_on_areas
- **Layout**: summaries_columns (2 | 4)
- **Area-level**: areas_display.hidden, areas_display.order
- **Entity-level**: areas_options.{areaId}.groups_options.{domain}.hidden
- **Special**: room_pin_entities, alarm_entity, favorite_entities, custom_views

## Complexity Hotspots

These files require extra care — changes here most likely cause regressions:

1. **editor/StrategyEditor.ts** — Editor state management, expand state persistence, config-changed events
2. **views/RoomViewStrategy.ts** — Entity categorization across 15+ device classes
3. **Registry.ts** — Central data layer, all views depend on its Maps/Sets
4. **utils/name-utils.ts** — Utilities used everywhere (changes ripple through entire codebase)

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g. `feature/climate-summary-view`)
2. Build: `npm run build` (production) or `npm run build-dev` (with source maps)
3. Deploy: copy `dist/` contents to your local HA's `www/community/oriel-dashboard/` directory for live testing
4. Delete stale `.gz` and `.br` files after copying (HA serves compressed over `.js` if present)
5. Hard-refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R). HA restart only needed for structural changes, not logic changes
6. **Test on the live system** — always before pushing to GitHub!
7. Test via Playwright and/or HA MCP tools

**Build scripts:**
```
npm run build       # Production (minified, no source maps)
npm run build-dev   # Development (source maps)
npm run watch       # Dev + auto-rebuild on file changes
```

## Git & Release Workflow

**Never commit directly to `main`.** Always use feature branches.

### Feature Development
1. `git checkout -b feature/<name>` from `main`
2. Develop, build, test on live system
3. Commit source changes only. **Don't commit `dist/`** — it's rebuilt fresh from source at release time (see Release Flow below)
4. `git push -u origin feature/<name>`
5. Create PR from feature branch → `main` (triggers HACS validation workflow)
6. Wait for CI to pass, then merge
7. Delete feature branch (local + remote)

### Release Flow

What happens after your PR merges to `main`:

1. **release-please** opens (or updates) a chore PR titled `chore(main): release <next-version>` — bumps `package.json` + appends a CHANGELOG entry. Conventional-commit prefixes drive the bump: `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:` → major. `docs:` and `chore:` don't trigger a release; `test:` triggers a patch but doesn't appear in the changelog (release-please default config).
2. **Merging the release PR** tags the new version and publishes a GitHub Release.
3. **`release-build.yml`** triggers on the `release: published` event, checks out the tagged commit, runs `npm ci && npm run build`, and uploads every file in `dist/` as an individual release asset (`gh release upload <tag> dist/* --clobber`).
4. **HACS users fetch the release assets**, not the source tree. The source-tree `dist/` is not load-bearing for users — release-build.yml builds it fresh on every release.

See [docs/RELEASE-INFRASTRUCTURE.md](docs/RELEASE-INFRASTRUCTURE.md) for the GitHub App + release-please auth setup that lets the `release: published` event actually fire `release-build.yml` (the suppression-rule workaround).

### Porting Community PRs
When PRs were created against the old codebase and cannot be merged directly:
1. Manually port the changes into the current TypeScript codebase
2. Credit the original author as `Co-Authored-By: Name <user@users.noreply.github.com>` in the commit
3. Close the original PR with a friendly comment + link to the release
4. Issue reference in the commit (`Closes #XX`) automatically closes the issue on merge

## How we work

**Default to action within scope; pause at boundaries.** When a task has a clear spec — a [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) §2 entry, or explicit acceptance criteria — execute through implementation, testing, PR, CI, squash-merge, branch delete, and wait for release-please without intermediate check-ins. The release PR is the review point. Report when it's ready for the user's approval.

**The spec is the contract.** If the work fits the spec, execute it. If it doesn't, surface why before adapting.

**Investigate before deciding.** When evidence is missing, gather it read-only and report findings — don't guess and ship.

**Audits are how the docs stay honest.** Run them deliberately; treat findings as evidence, not action items. Audits happen when docs get used, not on a schedule — trying to follow an instruction or use a reference is itself an audit, and drift surfaces under pressure of actual use. When you notice a doc claim doesn't match reality during normal work, treat it as an audit finding: open a follow-up, don't paper over.

**The user picks direction. You pick implementation.**

**Stop and surface when:**

- Scope grew past the spec.
- Two valid paths exist and the choice changes the product.
- Evidence contradicts the spec.
- A [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) principle would be violated to complete the task.

**Cross-fork PR safety.** `TheDave94/oriel-dashboard` hosts head branches for open PRs in `TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy`. Deleting any such branch in this repo auto-closes the upstream PR. Before any **bulk** branch deletion — manual or automated — check [`docs/protected-branches.md`](docs/protected-branches.md) (the snapshot of currently-protected branches) and refresh it via the procedure in that file's header. **Single-branch** deletions during normal merge-and-cleanup flow only need the check if the branch name matches a pattern that could plausibly be an upstream PR head (e.g. `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `grouped/*`, `chore/*` are all in the protected set today; `release-please--*`, `docs/*`, `feature/*` (with the trailing `ure`), and `investigation/*` are not). The `.github/workflows/protect-upstream-pr-branches.yml` workflow is a smoke alarm that fails loudly post-deletion with a recovery command — it does not prevent the deletion, since GitHub doesn't expose pre-delete hooks on standard repos. Treat the alarm as a hard stop: recover and surface, don't proceed.

## Design Decisions

Deliberate architecture decisions that should not be changed:

### Code-Split Chunk Architecture (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
The bundle is deliberately split into 5 chunks:

| Chunk | Contents | Size | Loads |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| `main` (Entry) | Custom element registration | tiny | Immediately — must register before HA's 5s timeout |
| `lit` | Lit framework (shared) | small | Async, shared by core/views/editor |
| `core` | Registry, Utils, Cards, OverviewView | medium | Async, for the home screen |
| `views` | Lights/Covers/Security/Batteries/Climate/Room Views | small | Async, on navigation |
| `editor` | StrategyEditor + js-yaml | large | On-demand, only when user opens config |

**Why:** Without code splitting, the entry point was a single large bundle. HA has a fixed 5-second timeout for custom element registration. On slow connections (Slow 4G), the JS file competes with all other HA chunks and custom cards for max. 6 browser connections. With the tiny entry point, the element registers instantly while the rest loads in the background.

**Content-Hash Chunk Filenames:** Chunks include a `[contenthash:8]` in their filename (e.g. `oriel-core.c6a1e2e6.js`). HACS only sets its cache-busting `hacstag` on the entry file — without content hashes, browsers would serve stale cached chunks after a HACS update.

### No Auto-Detection for Temperature/Humidity on Area Cards
The overview area cards only show `sensor_classes` (temperature, humidity) when the user has explicitly assigned an entity in the **HA area settings** (`area.temperature_entity_id`, `area.humidity_entity_id`). No auto-detection because:
- Wrong sensors would be displayed (e.g. printer temperature in the office)
- The user would have no way to remove them
- HA's own Home Strategy does it the same way

**Note:** In room detail views (RoomViewStrategy), sensors ARE auto-detected — they appear as badges and can be filtered via `no_dboard` label or `groups_options.hidden`.

### Pre-filtered Features on Area Cards and Tile Cards (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
Area cards only receive `controls` that actually exist in the area (e.g. `['light', 'cover-shutter']`), not all possible controls. Tile cards only receive `features` that the entity supports (e.g. `light-brightness` only for lights with brightness support, `climate-hvac-modes` only for climate entities).

**Why:** Without pre-filtering, each card must scan all entities itself — with many areas and entities, this causes massive load times on weak devices (tablets, wall panels). Check here first when investigating performance issues!

### Custom Cards: LitElement with Reactive willUpdate() (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
All custom cards (SummaryCard, LightsGroupCard, CoversGroupCard) use LitElement with `willUpdate(changedProps)` instead of the previous innerHTML rebuild pattern. This means:
- HA calls `card.hass = ...` on **every** state change (any entity in the entire system) — this happens hundreds of times per minute
- Without the reactive pattern, each card would rebuild its entire DOM on every `set hass()` call → massive performance problems
- With `willUpdate()`, cards check whether relevant states actually changed and only re-render when needed
- SummaryCard additionally caches relevant entity IDs (`_relevantEntityIds`) and only invalidates the cache on registry changes (`oldHass.entities !== this.hass.entities`)
- LightsGroupCard and CoversGroupCard use tile card pooling (DOM elements are reused instead of recreated)

**Why:** The migration from innerHTML to LitElement + willUpdate was extensive, but without this pattern the dashboard is unusable on weak devices (tablets, wall panels). Do not revert!

### Climate Summary Default: Off
`show_climate_summary` defaults to `false` because not every user has thermostats. All other summaries (lights, covers, security, batteries) default to on.

## Knowledge map

In-repo docs and when to load each. Inline references to these files elsewhere in CLAUDE.md remain authoritative for context-specific use; the table below is the index.

|------|--------------|
| `EXTERNAL_COUPLING.md` | Renaming or removing a config field that Oriel reads from HA entities; any house_mode-related work; any change to the dashboard-rename detection story. Mirrored verbatim from the HA-config repo — both repos own the contract. |
