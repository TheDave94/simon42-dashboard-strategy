# Roadmap

A current-state snapshot — not a list of aspirations. The project's working pattern is measured-and-reactive: features ship when a real signal justifies them. See [PRINCIPLES.md §5](PRINCIPLES.md) for the why.

> **Maintenance contract.** This file is updated at every release boundary: §1's version line must match the latest published tag, and §2 must not list items already shipped. Drift here is an audit finding — flag it as a violation when you spot it, don't paper over.

## 1. Current state

Oriel Dashboard is a Home Assistant Lovelace strategy at **v4.13.0**. It auto-generates dashboards from areas, devices, and entities, and exposes every advanced feature through a visual editor instead of YAML. For "what changed" by version, read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) or the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/TheDave94/oriel-dashboard/releases) page; this file does not duplicate that.

The strategy targets HA 2025.5+. The infrastructure-side state (release loop, branch hygiene, dependency posture) is documented in [docs/RELEASE-INFRASTRUCTURE.md](docs/RELEASE-INFRASTRUCTURE.md). The design principles every feature has to clear are in [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md).

## 2. Near-term plan

Concrete items intended to ship, with acceptance criteria recorded so the work doesn't drift. Each entry would carry: **what** changes, **why** it's worth shipping now, **shape** of the work (size only, not a date), and **done when** — what makes the work finished.

*Currently empty.* The two items that lived here through v4.9.x — Bubble Card tile `tap_action` rewiring and the `camera_hero` editor surface — both shipped in v4.10.0 (#50, #52). Nothing new is queued; future items surface from §4's reactive sources rather than getting backfilled here speculatively.

## 3. Deliberately deferred

Items that were considered during a review cycle and explicitly held back, with the reasoning recorded so the decision survives staff turnover. Each entry: **what** the item is, **why deferred** at the time it was considered, **trigger to revisit** — the concrete condition that would make it worth shipping.

### StrategyEditor file split

- **What**: decompose `src/editor/StrategyEditor.ts` along a three-axis split (state vs. rendering vs. config mutators).
- **Why deferred** (follow-up #1): the file is 4140 lines / 148 cohesive methods, but extracting the per-tab render templates already captured the high-value ~40% of the win. The remaining split would require either ~80 lines of mixin plumbing or 100+ call-site changes for marginal benefit on the current scale.
- **Trigger to revisit**: a specific tab needs independent reuse or testing in isolation from the rest of the editor.

### Registry-rebuild perf mitigations

- **What**: optimizations (memoization, incremental rebuild, dirty-tracking) for the `Registry` rebuild path.
- **Why deferred** (follow-up #2): the perf bench measured 2.2–5.6ms on a 300-entity fixture; the spec's original 250ms budget was overstated by ~50–100×. There is no real problem to solve at current scale.
- **Trigger to revisit**: a user with a 1000+ entity install reports editor lag. The Registry-churn benchmark stays in CI as a regression guard against accidental slowdowns.

### Registry per-card render cost

- **What**: optimizations for per-card render cost when HA pushes irrelevant `hass` updates (the `@property hass` decorator re-renders cards regardless of whether any entity they care about actually changed).
- **Why deferred** (Registry.ts:115-125, v4.7.0): real cost but architecturally separate from Registry-rebuild. v4.7.0 shipped Registry-rebuild measurement + coalescing; this remaining axis was acknowledged but not actioned because there was no signal that it mattered in practice.
- **Trigger to revisit**: stutter / dropped-frame report on a large install, or a profiler trace showing the render path dominates a real workload.

### Dashboard-level axe-core scan

- **What**: an axe-core a11y sweep that covers the rendered dashboard (cards in their actual mount position) on top of the existing editor scan.
- **Why deferred** (follow-up #3): cards live ~7 shadow boundaries deep inside HA's frontend (`home-assistant → home-assistant-main → ha-drawer → partial-panel-resolver → ha-panel-lovelace → hui-root → hui-view → hui-section → oriel-*-card`). axe's `.include()` API needs either a light-DOM selector or an exact shadow-piercing path, both brittle against HA frontend churn. Card a11y is already covered by `lit-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` at lint time and by the `keyboard-a11y.spec.ts` Playwright spec at runtime.
- **Trigger to revisit**: axe gains a public API for HA-shadow-piercing scope, or a real a11y bug surfaces against a card that lit-a11y missed.

### Editor color-token migration

- **What**: migrate the editor's CSS from legacy HA variable names (`--primary-color` family) to modern design tokens, matching the migration done for cards.
- **Why deferred** (follow-up #2, partial migration): cards finished the migration in v4.7.0. The editor stays on legacy because the HA components it embeds (`ha-form`, `ha-switch`, `ha-combo-box`) still use the legacy names internally, and migrating only the editor's outer chrome would create token-inconsistency seams with the embedded HA components. The README claim about design-token coverage was qualified accordingly.
- **Trigger to revisit**: HA's own theme system drops the legacy variable names, forcing all consumers to migrate together.

### Live-preview visual rendering

- **What**: render a sandboxed `<hui-view>` inside the live-preview pane so users see what the dashboard will actually look like, not just its structural outline.
- **Why deferred** (`src/editor/LivePreview.ts:12-15`, v4.6.0): HA doesn't expose `<hui-view>` as an embeddable component. The structure-level preview (view/section/card counts + emitted YAML) was shipped as the pragmatic middle ground; a true visual preview would need either a public HA API change or a substantial reimplementation of HA's view rendering.
- **Trigger to revisit**: HA exposes `<hui-view>` (or an equivalent embeddable component) as a public API, or a user reports that the text-only preview is insufficient for the decisions they're making in the editor.

### Priority / precedence "status headline" element (external-seed review, 2026-05)

- **What**: a single glanceable element resolving the home's top-priority state via a configured precedence (e.g. security > window-open-in-rain > air-quality > climate > all-clear), showing only the winner instead of the flat equal-weight summary row.
- **Why deferred**: speculative (PRINCIPLES §5) — seeded from an external mascot-card review, not an Oriel user signal. The summaries are *deliberately* flat (`oriel-summary-card`, five fixed types) and `show_unavailable_alert_badge` already surfaces the main "something's wrong" signal; the marginal value is single-glance precedence ordering, which is unvalidated. A real version needs a user-defined precedence + a condition engine + an editor surface (§3) — non-trivial config for an unproven benefit. Note: users can already drop an ad-hoc status template into the summaries row via `custom_cards` → `target_section: summaries`.
- **Trigger to revisit**: a real request for a "what matters now" headline, or enough users hand-rolling summary-row status templates that a first-class precedence element clearly pays off. If built: an overview-header element (sibling to the clock/alarm/house-mode badge) or `oriel-status-card`, fed by an ordered condition list reusing the existing summary aggregations.

### Mode-keyed section visibility (external-seed review, 2026-05) — *largely already covered*

- **What**: change *which* sections/content appear per house_mode / time-of-day, not just their order.
- **Why deferred / mostly covered**: context-driven presentation is already a first-class axis — `sections_order_by_mode` (order per `house_mode_entity`), `section_visibility` (conditional show/hide, e.g. "agenda only on workdays"), viewport detection (phone / tablet / wall = wall-panel mode), density presets, per-area `room_mode_entity`, plus HA-native card `visibility` conditions (used by v4.13 state-gated favorites) for per-card mode/time gating. The external framing ("room to make modes first-class") underestimates what's already shipped. Residual gap is narrow: a `sections_visible_by_mode` mirror of `sections_order_by_mode` for users who want whole sections gated by mode without writing per-section conditions.
- **Trigger to revisit**: a request that `section_visibility`'s condition form genuinely can't satisfy.

## 4. Reactive next steps

Future work is driven by what surfaces — bug reports, feature requests on this repo or upstream simon42, deferred items above whose trigger condition fires, gaps revealed when the HA frontend evolves. There is no static roadmap, and items that look interesting in the abstract don't reach §2 unless something real has validated them. See [PRINCIPLES.md §5](PRINCIPLES.md) for the rationale; the previous shape of this file (long aspirational tiers) is exactly what that principle exists to discourage.

## 5. Out of scope

Explicit boundary statements — useful for setting expectations even when no one's asking. Each line is a thing this project has decided not to do, with the reason it stays decided.

- **Backend HA service integration** — Oriel is frontend-only. Surfaces like `strategy.flash_view` would require a Python integration component; that's a different project.
- **Backwards-compat layer for upstream simon42 identifiers** — the clean break is intentional. Migration is a one-shot YAML edit; see [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
- **Hard dependency on any HACS plugin** — every feature must work in a clean fallback path. See [PRINCIPLES.md §2](PRINCIPLES.md).
- **Standalone web-app surfaces** — Oriel is a Lovelace *strategy* (it generates `views[]` from HA metadata). A bespoke standalone HTML/JS app talking to HA over WS/REST (the Reddit "rich media-center surface" pattern) is a different product: not strategy-generatable, bypasses HA's dashboard / auth / theming, and is a separate deploy + maintenance model. Rich surfaces are served the Oriel way — `custom_cards` (HACS cards), `custom_views` (reference a bespoke dashboard), and the plugin shims (ApexCharts, Bubble, floorplan). Considered + rejected in the 2026-05 external-seed review.
